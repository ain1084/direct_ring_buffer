A high-performance, lock-free ring buffer for Rust.  
Designed for safe, efficient bulk data transfer â€” ideal for real-time systems such as **audio streaming** or **signal processing**.

---

## Features

- **Lock-free** design using atomic operations (single-producer / single-consumer)  
- **Full-capacity utilization** â€” all allocated elements are usable  
- **Stable wrap-around alignment** for predictable block-based I/O  
- **Slice-based read/write API** for high-throughput contiguous access  
- **Thread-safe** operation without explicit locking  
- **No heap allocation during runtime** â€” only during buffer creation  
- **Supports `Drop` types** safely (`Vec`, `String`, etc.)  
- **Miri-verified** â€” passes [Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri) with no undefined behavior  

---

## Overview

A **ring buffer** (also known as a circular buffer) provides a fixed-size queue that efficiently reuses memory for continuous read/write operations.

This crate differs from many common ring buffer implementations in several key ways:

- It allows the **entire buffer capacity** to be used â€” no slot is reserved to distinguish full/empty states.  
  For example, a buffer created with a capacity of 2048 elements can actually hold all 2048.
- When reading and writing in consistent block sizes,  
  the wrap-around point remains **stable and predictable**, which is especially valuable for **audio and streaming systems**.
- It focuses on **slice-based operations** rather than element-by-element methods like `push` / `pop`,  
  enabling bulk data movement and better cache locality.

All internal elements are safely initialized using `T::default()`,  
eliminating undefined behavior (UB) while maintaining performance comparable to traditional uninitialized approaches.

---

## Type Constraints

The type parameter `T` no longer needs to be `Copy` for the buffer itself.  
All internal elements are fully initialized at creation time using `T::default()`.

Operation-level requirements:

- **`read_element` / `write_element`** â€” require `T: Copy`, since they move values by copy.  
- **`read_slices` / `write_slices`** â€” do *not* require `Copy`; they operate directly on initialized memory.

This enables both high-performance numeric buffers and safe use of complex types.

---

## Examples

### Minimal (no wrap-around; ignore offset)

```rust
use direct_ring_buffer::create_ring_buffer;

let (mut producer, mut consumer) = create_ring_buffer::<u8>(5);

// Write 4 elements in one contiguous region.
// We know wrap-around won't happen, so we ignore `offset`.
producer.write_slices(|buf, offset| {
    assert_eq!(offset, 0);
    buf[..4].copy_from_slice(&[1, 2, 3, 4]);
    4 // number of elements written
}, None);

// Read back the same 4 elements in one contiguous region.
// Again, no wrap-around here; `offset` is irrelevant.
consumer.read_slices(|buf, offset| {
    assert_eq!(offset, 0);
    assert_eq!(&buf[..4], &[1, 2, 3, 4]);
    4 // number of elements read
}, None);
```

### Wrap-Around

```rust
use direct_ring_buffer::create_ring_buffer;

let (mut producer, mut consumer) = create_ring_buffer::<u8>(5);

// Prep: fill 4 slots so the head/tail positions make the next write split.
// Then consume only 3, leaving 1 element inside to force a wrap on the next write.
producer.write_slices(|buf, _| {
    buf[..4].copy_from_slice(&[1, 2, 3, 4]);
    4
}, None);
consumer.read_slices(|buf, _| {
    assert_eq!(&buf[..3], &[1, 2, 3]);
    3
}, None);
// Buffer now holds a single element `[4]` near the end; the next write will wrap.

// Write 3 elements in **one** call. The closure may be invoked twice:
// - first for the tail end (offset = 0, write 1 element),
// - second for the wrapped beginning (offset = 1, write 2 elements).
let write_seq = [6, 7, 8];
producer.write_slices(|buf, offset| {
    // `offset` is the linear position (in elements) already written in THIS call.
    let n = buf.len().min(write_seq.len() - offset);
    buf[..n].copy_from_slice(&write_seq[offset..offset + n]);
    n
}, None);

// Read back all 4 elements now in the buffer: `[4, 6, 7, 8]`.
// This read may also split into two contiguous chunks (end then start).
let mut out = [0u8; 4];
consumer.read_slices(|buf, offset| {
    // `offset` is the linear position already read in THIS call.
    let n = buf.len().min(out.len() - offset);
    out[offset..offset + n].copy_from_slice(&buf[..n]);
    n
}, None);

assert_eq!(out, [4, 6, 7, 8]);
```

ðŸ’¬ **Notes**

- The closure can be called up to twice per operation (once for the tail, once for the wrapped head).
- On the first invocation offset == 0; if a second invocation occurs, offset equals the number of elements processed in the first invocation.
- Always return the actual number of elements written/read (â‰¤ buf.len()); returning less stops the operation early.

### Single-element

```rust
use direct_ring_buffer::create_ring_buffer;

let (mut producer, mut consumer) = create_ring_buffer::<u8>(4);

// Step 1: Write 4 elements (fill the buffer)
for i in 1..=4 {
    assert!(producer.write_element(i));
}

// Step 2: Read 2 elements
for expected in [1, 2] {
    let value = consumer.read_element().unwrap();
    assert_eq!(value, expected);
}

// Step 3: Write 2 more elements (these will wrap around internally)
for i in [5, 6] {
    assert!(producer.write_element(i));
}

// Step 4: Read all 4 elements now in the buffer
let mut result = Vec::new();
while let Some(v) = consumer.read_element() {
    result.push(v);
}

assert_eq!(result, vec![3, 4, 5, 6]);
```

ðŸ’¡ **Explanation**

- write_element() writes a single element if space is available and returns true on success.
- read_element() reads one element if available and returns Some(T).
- The example shows:
  1. Fill the buffer ([1, 2, 3, 4])
  2. Consume 2 elements ([1, 2])
  3. Add 2 new elements ([5, 6]) â€” this triggers wrap-around internally
- Read the remaining 4 elements in order ([3, 4, 5, 6])

## Safety and Performance

All internal memory is safely initialized â€” no uninitialized or dangling references are used anywhere.  
Atomic operations ensure consistent synchronization between producer and consumer threads without locks.

The code internally uses a small number of `unsafe` blocks,  
but every instance has been validated to conform to Rustâ€™s aliasing and ownership rules.

This implementation has been verified to pass **Miri**,  
confirming that it exhibits **no undefined behavior under Rust's memory model**.

Performance remains comparable or better than the prior uninitialized version,  
since initialization with `Default` occurs only once during construction.

---

## Notes

This crate was refactored to remove all unsafe uninitialized memory handling  
and is now fully compliant with Miri and Rustâ€™s strict aliasing model.

While previous versions worked in practice,  
this implementation guarantees correctness by design â€” both in safe and `unsafe` contexts.

Its slice-oriented API and full-capacity utilization make it ideal for real-time streaming workloads,  
where stable boundaries and predictable throughput are essential.
